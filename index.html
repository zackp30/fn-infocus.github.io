            <h1>What we're about.</h1>
            <p>We're people on IRC who communicate on IRC because we genuinely want to talk to others about the great things we do. We don't want to be patronizing and we don't want to try and impress, but help grow and enrich each other through the medium of communication, helping us get better at what we do, and helping others get into our field and advance to do soe great things.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="theme2" id="rules">
        <div class="container">
            <h1>Our Simple Rules.</h1>
            <p>Unlike other places on IRC where operators understand some people might not grasp how to behave socially and make allowances for some, but not for everyone, we have a simple protocol to follow for those who seem to not have a grasp for the rules: We'll give you three informal warnings (or less if we feel what you've done is serious enough) and then we'll dicipline you the way we feel is right, whether that be via a quiet (+q), ban (+b) or kick.</p>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
                <div class="col-xs-2">
                    <div class="rule-number">1</div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-xs-10">
                    <p><strong>Don't be a dick.</strong></p>
                    <p>This applies especially to kids and other people who don't know how to act online. So someone agreed with you? Doesn't mean you're being invalidated or that you rights have been bruised. IRC is a medium where people can have an opinion - while yours is important, so are everyone else's.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
                <div class="col-xs-2">
                    <div class="rule-number">2</div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-xs-10">
                    <p><strong>Be respectful.</strong></p>
                    <p>Online, you will meet all sorts of people. These people might identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transexual or any other part of the LGBT spectrum. It's important that you don't treat these people any different than how you treat others here. Everyone's here to have a casual chat, let's not ruin that.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">

                </div>
                <div class="col-xs-10">
                    <p><strong>Respect that others make mistakes.</strong></p>
                    <p>We're all human, and making mistakes is part of what we all do in our everyday busy lives. If someone's made a mistake or done/said something they shouldn't have, or was wrong in saying then don't use this as ammunition to ignite or keep an argument/debate heated. You, like them, will also make a mistake someday.</p>

                <div class="col-xs-10">
                    <p><strong>If all else fails, use common sense.</strong></p>
                    <p>We make mistakes, we're sometimes disrespectful and we're sometimes a dick. We can do some other controversial things too - but if something here isn't covered well by something, common sense really must pervail. The channel operators are peace keepers and must enforce common sense. These rules aren't like the bible.</p>
