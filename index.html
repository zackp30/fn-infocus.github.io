            <h1>What the $*%&amp; is ##infocus?</h1>
            <p>We're people on IRC who like to debate about general everyday stuff as well as things related to our hobbies. Hobbies are a great way to socialise and get to meet new people, and it's great to listen to what other people do for fun. At ##infocus we're a friendly laid-back channel for just that - to allow people to discuss what interests them most in a non-competitive non-patronizing environment everyone can enjoy.</p>
            <p><strong>##infocus @ irc.freenode.net</strong> - How you connect, that's up to you.</p>

            <h1>No Bullshit&trade; Rules.</h1>
            <p>While other places on IRC have a certain topic, we're quite unique in that we don't care about what you talk about as long as it meets the rules of both freenode the network, and our channel, which can change anytime we feel there needs to be clarification on the rules sometime. Here are the rules for the channel in a quick and easy list.</p>
            <div class="row rule">
                <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-12">
                    <div class="col-xs-2 text-center">

                    </div>
                    <div class="col-xs-10">
                        <h4><strong>Be Respectful.</strong></h4>
                        <p>Respect is what drives a community. Without respect, the community isn't a community. Being nice to people of all ages, genders and backgrounds is vitally important in the eyes of channel administration. We especially do not tolerate any slurs - whether it be towards a majority or a minotiry - it's not tolerated.</p>

                        <h4><strong>Don't be a dick.</strong></h4>
                        <p>Being pretentious - respect that others may not have as much experience as you, or that they don't seek to know the same amount that you do - calling someone a offensive name because they don't quite understand something is not being helpful - it's being pretentious and can be seen as bragging, or general dickery.</p>

                        <p>In cases where you're unsure whether something is the right thing to say, or that what you say might cause offense it's usually best to not say it, or use your common sense to determine the concequences of what you're saying. We all posess common sense, so let's all use it.</p>

Channel staff have the final say in verdicts and outcomes of channel punishments/interventions.</p>
